## For this project, I used data downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equinxx/spotify-top-50-songs-in-2021). 
## I created a table I could input the downloaded data into, and performed analytics on that data using SQL.

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.SpotifyData (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
artist_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
track_name VARCHAR NOT NULL, 
track_id VARCHAR NOT NULL, 
popularity INTEGER NOT NULL, 
danceability DECIMAL(4,3) NOT NULL, 
energy DECIMAL(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key INTEGER NOT NULL,
loudness DECIMAL (5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode INTEGER NOT NULL,
speechiness DECIMAL (5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness DECIMAL(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumental DECIMAL (8,7) NOT NULL, 
liveness DECIMAL (5,4) NOT NULL,
valence DECIMAL (4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo DECIMAL (6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms INTEGER NOT NULL,
time_signature INTEGER NOT NULL);

SELECT distinct artist_name, COUNT(id) as NumSongs

SELECT song_mode, AVG(popularity)
